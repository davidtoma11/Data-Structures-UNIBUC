# - Red-Black Tree
A Red-Black Tree is an advanced binary search tree data structure that enforces specific balancing rules to ensure performance and efficiency in insertion, deletion, and search operations. It is named after the colors assigned to its nodes, which can be either red or black.

Key Characteristics of the Red-Black Tree:

ðŸ”¹ Balancing Rules: The tree follows five balancing rules that maintain a well-structured and nearly balanced form, ensuring a maximum depth of 2 log(n), where n is the number of nodes. These rules include color properties that enforce that every simple path from the root to a leaf node contains the same number of black nodes.

ðŸ”¹ Efficient Operations: The Red-Black Tree supports insertion, deletion, and search operations with an average time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes. The balancing rules prevent the tree from becoming skewed or degenerating into a linear list, maintaining optimal performance.

ðŸ”¹ Applications in Computing: Due to its efficiency and guaranteed performance, the Red-Black Tree is widely used in the implementation of other data structures such as AVL trees, databases, and sorting algorithms. It is particularly useful in scenarios where an ordered and balanced data structure is required.

ðŸ”¹ Complex Implementation: A correct implementation of the Red-Black Tree involves managing node colors, performing subtree rotations, and applying balancing rules based on the performed operations. This requires careful handling and a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms.
